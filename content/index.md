# Fullstack Web Developer
Hi! 👋🏾 I'm Olly (she/her), welcome to my personal website. I'm a fullstack Python web developer with a deep interest in philosophy, programming, and English literature. 

I graduated from Cal State Fullerton in 2022 with a Bachelor of Arts in English and Philosophy. In my spare time I enjoy hiking, reading, and playing video games with my partner. My favorite literary genres are science fiction and romanticism; as you could probably guess, my favourite author is Mary Shelley.
