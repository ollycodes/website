# About Me

Hi, 👋🏽 I’m Olly (she/her), a fullstack web developer with a passion for building modern and user-friendly web applications. I’m proficient in Python, Django, SQLite, HTML, and CSS. I recently graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a Bachelor of Arts in English and Philosophy.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, reading, and programming. My favorite genres are science fiction and romanticism; my favorite author is Mary Shelley.

I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I’m confident that I have the skills and experience to be a valuable asset to your team. ✨
