# About this website

Perhaps it's a matter of old-school principle or a desire to build something on my own. This website was made
to help me develop my skills as a programmer and to create a space for my own thought. Here you will find posts
about philosophy, programming, and many other topics I'm interested in. I hope you enjoy your stay.

# About Me

Hi, 👋🏽 I’m Olly (she/her), a fullstack web developer. I’m proficient in Python, Django, SQLite, HTML, and CSS. I recently graduated from Cal State Fullerton with a Bachelor of Arts in English and Philosophy.

In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and playing video games and MtG with my SO. My favorite literary genres are science fiction and romanticism; as you could probably guess, my favorite author is Mary Shelley.

I’m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. If you’re interested in learning more about me, please feel free to contact me. ✨
